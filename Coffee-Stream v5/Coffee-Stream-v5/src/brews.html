Espresso is a strong black coffee made by forcing steam through dark-roast aromatic coffee beans at high pressure in an espresso machine. A perfectly brewed espresso will have a thick, golden-brown crema (foam) on the surface. If the crema is good, the sugar you add will float on the surface for a couple of seconds before slowly sinking to the bottom.</p>
<p>Espresso is the foundation for a wide variety of specialty coffee drinks, such as the cappuccino, but many aficionados and purists insist that adding anything (besides a bit of sugar) is blasphemy, akin to Scotch lovers mixing their single malt with Coke.</p>

			<p>This hugely popular coffee drink has become a staple that even the most common of corner coffee shops carries (or at least a version of it). A true cappuccino is a combination of equal parts espresso, steamed milk and milk froth. This luxurious drink, if made properly, can double as a dessert with its complex flavors and richness.</p>

            <p>An Americano is a single shot of espresso added to a cup of hot water. The name is thought to have originated as a bit of an insult to Americans, who had to dilute their espresso when it first gained popularity on this side of the pond. Many coffee houses have perfected it, however, and the result has become a creamy, rich espresso-based coffee that you can sip and savor before jumping on your Vespa and heading to the soccer field.</p>
			<p><strong>How to Have it: </strong>Many like to drink it as they would their regular brewed coffee, with milk and/or sugar, but connoisseurs suggest keeping milk to a minimum to get the most flavor from the espresso.</p>
			<p><strong>Give it a twist: </strong>Americano is not commonly taken with a twist, but having it "iced" is a great treat on a hot day.</p>
